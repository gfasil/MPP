problem 1: here we didn't override hash code correctly so when the remove duplicate method tries to put an employee in the hashmap,
first it calculates the hash code using super class's(Object) hashcode method then puts it in the map, next time the same object is inserted into
the map, the hashcode will be different so same objects will always have differnt key.therefore, the contains key method will always return false.
so duplicate will still be added to the list.
solution is to override hash code inside Employee !
