problem 1: the equals method inside employee accepts Employee object as an argument.now this is okay to compare two employees
but, there will be a problem when we have to compare employee with an Object type and we have to call the equals method inside the Object class
thats why it returns false.
here the contains method inside lists are equal method is calling superclass's equal because we did not properly override equals inside employee
